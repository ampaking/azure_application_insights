# Implementing Advanced Monitoring in Python FastAPI Applications with Azure Application Insights

In modern software development, monitoring capabilities are the cornerstone for observing the state of applications and proactively resolving issues. This article focuses on simplifying the integration process of Python FastAPI applications with Azure Application Insights, enabling developers, including beginners, to effectively implement advanced monitoring solutions.

## Prerequisites for Seamless Integration

Before integrating Azure Application Insights into your Python application, you need to prepare the following:

- An Azure subscription.
- An App Service or similar, created for your Python application.
- Python 3.7 or higher.

## Setting Up Azure Application Insights

The first step is to set up an Azure Application Insights resource. This process provides you with an essential connection string. Keep this connection string secure, as it will be necessary for configuring your application.

## Installing Required Packages

Use pip to install the `azure-monitor-opentelemetry` and `opentelemetry-instrumentation-fastapi` packages, and add them to your project's `requirements.txt` file to manage dependencies efficiently.

```
pip install azure-monitor-opentelemetry
pip install opentelemetry-instrumentation-fastapi
```

## Configuration

Configuration management is crucial. Save the Azure Application Insights connection string in an environment variable to access it securely and flexibly. Here's how you can enforce this setting in your application:

```
import os
import logging

from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException
from azure.monitor.opentelemetry import configure_azure_monitor
from opentelemetry.instrumentation.fastapi import FastAPIInstrumentor

from dotenv import load_dotenv

# Load environment variable
load_dotenv()

# Configure logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
logger = logging.getLogger("uvicorn")

app = FastAPI()

APPLICATIONINSIGHTS_CONNECTION_STRING = os.getenv(
    "APPLICATIONINSIGHTS_CONNECTION_STRING"
)

# Simple validation
assert (
    APPLICATIONINSIGHTS_CONNECTION_STRING
), "APPLICATIONINSIGHTS_CONNECTION_STRING is not set."

try:
    configure_azure_monitor(
        connection_string=APPLICATIONINSIGHTS_CONNECTION_STRING,
    )
    FastAPIInstrumentor.instrument_app(app)
except Exception as e:
    raise HTTPException(
        status_code=500,
        detail=f"Application Insights was not set up properly. {(str(e))}",
    ) from e

@app.get("/health_check")
async def health_check():
    """
    The `health_check` function in Python implements custom logic for performing a health check and
    returns a dictionary with a status message.
    :return: The `health_check` function is returning a dictionary with a key "status" and the value "I
    am ok!!!."
    """

    logger.info("Health check endpoint was called")

    return {"status": "I am ok!!!"}
```

This simple endpoint functions as a health check to confirm that the application is up and can handle requests. Incorporating such endpoints is important for maintaining the reliability and performance of your application.

## Conclusion

Integrating Python FastAPI applications with Azure Application Insights significantly enhances observability by providing deep insights into application performance and user experience. This guide, aimed at developers of all levels, demonstrates the ease of setting up this powerful monitoring tool. By following these steps, you can ensure your application is robust, high-performing, and reliable, thereby enhancing your ability to deliver an outstanding user experience.
